**Human Pose Estimation with OpenCV and TensorFlow**
<br>
This project implements Human Pose Estimation using OpenCV and TensorFlow. The aim is to estimate the positions of human body parts from an image using a pre-trained pose detection model. The model uses a deep learning-based approach to detect key body parts and draw skeleton-like connections on the human body in an image.

**Features:**
Upload any image to perform pose estimation.
Detects and estimates key body parts such as neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles.
Visualizes the detected key points and connects them with lines to create a human pose skeleton.
Adjust the detection threshold using a slider to improve detection accuracy based on your image.
**Technologies Used:**
Python: The programming language used for implementation.
OpenCV: A powerful library used for image processing tasks.
TensorFlow: Used to load and run the pre-trained human pose detection model.
Streamlit: Provides an interactive web interface for the application.
